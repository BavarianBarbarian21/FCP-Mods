Select {PAWN_labelShort} and look at {PAWN_possessive} 'Bandwidth' readout to see how much bandwidth {PAWN_pronoun} is currently using and how much {PAWN_pronoun} has available. Bandwidth can be increased with certain apparel and by building RobCo band node buildings.

To learn more about what each mode does, select the work mode icon on one of {PAWN_labelShort}'s control groups and hover over the different work orders. The maximum number of control groups can be increased with apparel and holotapes.

(*SectionTitle)About threat calling:(/SectionTitle) Mechanics can signal ancient leader bots to attack in order to obtain rare items from them. You must do this to improve your mechanitor past certain limits, but beware the danger.</LetterMechlinkInstalled>
